// The problem is to find shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge weighted directed Graph. 

//EXAMPLE:
// Input:
//        graph[][] = { {0,   5,  INF, 10},
//                     {INF,  0,  3,  INF},
//                     {INF, INF, 0,   1},
//                     {INF, INF, INF, 0} }
// which represents the following graph
//              10
//        (0)------->(3)
//         |         /|\
//       5 |          |
//         |          | 1
//        \|/         |
//        (1)------->(2)
//             3       
// Note that the value of graph[i][j] is 0 if i is equal to j 
// And graph[i][j] is INF (infinite) if there is no edge from vertex i to j.

// Output:
// Shortest distance matrix
//       0      5      8      9
//     INF      0      3      4
//     INF    INF      0      1
//     INF    INF    INF      0




// Floyd Warshall Algorithm 
// 1. We initialize the solution matrix same as the input graph matrix as a first step.
// 2.Then we update the solution matrix by considering all vertices as an intermediate vertex. 
//   The idea is to one by one pick all vertices and update all shortest paths which include the picked vertex as an intermediate vertex in the shortest path. 
//   When we pick vertex number k as an intermediate vertex, we already have considered vertices {0, 1, 2, .. k-1} as intermediate vertices. 
//   For every pair (i, j) of the source and destination vertices respectively, there are two possible cases:
// 
// a) k is not an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. We keep the value of dist[i][j] as it is. 
// b) k is an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. 
//    We update the value of dist[i][j] as dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
