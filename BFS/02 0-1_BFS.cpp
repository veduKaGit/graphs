// graph where every edge has weight as either 0 or 1.

// Find the shortest path from source vertex to every other vertex. 


===== VVIMP COMMENT, MUST READ!! DONT IGNNORE =====

// In this we will NOT use bool array to mark visited nodes (like we did in normal BFS)
// but at each step we will check for the optimal distance condition. 
  
// We use DEQUEUE to store the node. 
// if a edge having weight = 0 => node is pushed at front of DEQUEUE, and if a edge having weight = 1 => pushed at back of DEQUEUE.
// so that vertices are processed in increasing order of weights.
  
// The approach is similar to Dijkstra => if the shortest distance to node is relaxed by the previous node => then only it will be pushed in the queue. 

// The above idea works in all cases.
// when we pop a vertex (like Dijkstra), it is the minimum weight vertex among remaining vertices. 
// If there is a 0 weight vertex adjacent to it, then this adjacent has same distance. 
// If there is a 1 weight adjacent, then this adjacent has maximum distance among all vertices in dequeue (because all other vertices are either adjacent of currently popped vertex or adjacent of previously popped vertices).
